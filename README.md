# Game Recommendation System

This project implements a hybrid recommendation system for video games, utilizing both Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering techniques to provide personalized game recommendations.

## Project Overview

The recommendation system is designed to suggest games tailored to individual users based on three main approaches:
1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends games by identifying similar users and the games theyâ€™ve enjoyed, based on user interaction data.
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests games that are similar in genre, description, or other attributes to games the user has already liked.
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Integrates collaborative and content-based filtering to deliver well-rounded recommendations, enhancing personalization by accounting for both user preferences and game attributes.

## A/B Testing Framework

An A/B testing setup is included to evaluate the effectiveness of the different recommendation models:
- Users are randomly assigned to test groups (A/B).
- Each group receives recommendations generated by a different recommendation algorithm.
- Metrics like click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate are tracked to compare the models' performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**

## Dataset

The system leverages four datasets, providing comprehensive data about users, games, and user preferences:
1. **recommendations_df**: Contains user reviews and recommendations, representing a many-to-many relationship between games and users.
2. **games_df**: Provides game-related details, including ratings, price (in USD), and release date.
3. **games_metadata_df**: Includes additional metadata like tags, descriptions, and app IDs for each game.
4. **users_df**: Contains public user profile data, including the number of purchases and reviews published.

**Data Source**: The datasets are available on Kaggle and can be accessed here: [Game Recommendations on Steam](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonkozyriev/game-recommendations-on-steam). Due to their size, please download them directly from Kaggle.

## Key Functions

### `get_knn_recommendations(user_id)`
   - Implements Collaborative Filtering by finding users with similar preferences to the specified user and recommending games they enjoyed.

### `get_content_based_recommendations(game_title)`
   - Uses Content-Based Filtering to suggest games with attributes (like genre and tags) similar to the specified game title.

### `get_hybrid_recommendations(user_id, game_title)`
   - Combines Collaborative and Content-Based Filtering outputs to provide recommendations by assessing both user preferences and game content similarity.
